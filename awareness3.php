                        <p class="card-text">Every day you check your emails for messages from work, entertainment, friends,
                            shopping, and more. There are tools to keep your emails safe, but it’s ultimately up to you what emails you respond to. <br><br>

                            You’ve likely heard of ‘Phishing’ attacks before, this is where an email is sent to you pretending to be real but wants you to ‘click’ on a link,
                            website, or file attachment, that would harm your device. A Phishing attack can harm your device by installing malicious software or convinces you to go to a
                            ‘fake website’ where you would input your login details, stealing those details and the account.

                        <p class="card-text">Most emails you read, respond, or follow their instructions to connect with friends, confirm shopping orders, or check your accounts. When you receive a Phishing email,
                            it’s important to be able to detect it and avoid interacting with the email. The best response if you think an email is suspicious is to examine it for ‘indicators of phishing’ to confirm
                            it’s not a real email and report it to your organization or email provider. <br> <br>



                            It’s worth knowing that most emails you receive will be legitimate, and it’s important not to assume they’ll all be attacks,
                            or you’ll never get on with your day and get ‘security fatigue’. Just keep your eyes open and know that some people will try to trick you with fake emails. <br><br>

                            Whenever you see the easy to spot indicators the next part will teach you, you can stop and examine the email fully to check and feel safe. </p>

                        <p class="card-text">This training looks to change your ‘Heuristics’, also known as your email habits. This just
                            means changing your subconscious decision-making when you look
                            at an email and simply “know” whether it’s real or fake. Once you decide an email feels wrong, then you look at
                            it ‘systematically’ where you investigate further for the indicators of attack. <br><br>

                            There are 3 categories of indicators you should know.<br><br>

                            Contextual, Social, and Technical.

                By asking the five context questions, we can see if this email is a Phishing attack, or a real alert from eBay. <br><br>


                1. Did I expect this email? <br>
                I do not use eBay, so this is an unexpected email, and may be fake. <br><br>

                2. Is the email trying to grab my attention? <br>
                The subject line uses an ! to try to grab my attention, when a legitimate email would normally be more formal. <br><br>

                3. Do I recognize the sender? <br>
                I do not recognize the sender email address, this is the first time I've gotten a message from them, so there is no established trust. <br><br>

                4. Does the email know me?<br>
                The email is using a generic greeting, rather than any of my personal details. Real business emails would usually know my name and use it to appear legitimate. <br><br>

                5. Is the email trying to pressure me into a decision? <br>
                The email content states I will lose access to my eBay account if I don't comply. This pressures me to follow the link or risk losing something, a common phishing tactic. <br><br>
