                        <p class="card-text">Technical indicators are the hardest to spot, even IT professionals find it difficult,
                            but there are some common tricks in use that can let you know the email is an attempt to trick you. It
                            often comes down to two main pieces of information, the sender address of the email, and the link it
                            provides for you to connect to through your browser. If either of these are incorrect according to their
                            supposed source e.g. amazon, eBay, government entities, there’s a very good chance the email is fake and attempting to trick you.<br> <br>

                            If there’s no link, there will often be a file attachment or some form of contact information for you to follow up on.
                            It’s important not to interact with the attachment, as they often come with forms of malicious software called ‘malware’
                            that can harm your device. Following up and replying to the email may also cause trouble, as now this attacker knows
                            you may be vulnerable to further attacks.

                        <p class="card-text">A phishing email will almost always contain a ‘URL’ or ‘link’ to a website or download,
                            it’s their goal to make you click this link in order to attack your device. If we examine the email’s
                            link by hovering our mouse over it and seeing the URL in the bottom left of the screen, we can gain
                            insight into where it might be taking us. Generally, a phishing email will pretend to be a known brand,
                            organization, or person, but they can never attack you with the real website of that brand, therefore
                            the attacker must make some kind of copy. The URL leading you to the copy cannot be the same as the real
                            website, which means by reading the URL and noticing any differences or errors we can prove the email to be fake.<br><br>

                            This part is hard to absorb because URLs can be complicated, but the following features may indicate a malicious link.<br>

                            - numbers and random characters in the link. E.g, www.gwerh&te.com is not a safe URL.<br>

                            - Spelling mistakes in the URL, which may be intentional. E.g, eBay.com is real, but 3Bay.com is not.<br>

                            - use of dots and dashes within the name. E.g. Amazon.com is real, but amazon-services.com is not.<br>

                            - a bundle of numbers called an IP address without any name at all to read. E.g, www.162.454.31.25.2.com is not a safe URL.<br><br>



                            The URL of the email also be ‘obfuscated’ in which the link is not readable at all, only a
                            small jumble of characters hiding the actual destination. An email may also ‘hide’ the fake
                            URL under a real one, with the text claiming to bring you to facebook.com, but taking you to
                            hackerwebsite.org instead. It’s important to always hover the link before clicking to make sure
                            you’re going to a trusted site.

                        <h5 class="card-title">3 Sender Address and Domain</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Like URLs, the Sender of an email can prove an email is fake or real.
                            A sender ‘address’ and ‘domain’, generally, cannot be faked, so must look like but cannot
                            be the same as the ‘real’ domain it claims to come from. The ‘domain’ is the part of
                            the address after the @, which signifies what network it came from, and is the most
                            important part, as the address before the @ can be anything, if the total address is
                            unique. For example, a phishing attack may claim to be from amazon, but the sender
                            address is something like ‘amazon@amazon-services.com. Note that the start of the
                            address can say amazon, but that the domain cannot copy amazon's actual domain, and needs to use
                            similar tricks as a URL by adding a dash for its own custom and fake domain name.<br><br>

                            These URLs are one of the key indicators that can prove if an email is a phishing
                            attack or a real communication. A trusted URL will be short and recognizable,
                            with no spelling mistakes and a simple domain. E.g. “news@amazon.com”.<br><br>

                            The @amazon.com part cannot easily be copied.

                        <p class="card-text">Whatever email application you use, there will generally be advice and tools available.
                            If an email comes through that your provider thinks is suspicious, it will let you know with warning
                            symbols and may even block it automatically into your ‘junk’ folder. These emails are important
                            to keep in mind when dealing with suspicious emails, as they’ll sometimes be your first clue something is off.<br><br>

                            These warnings can include information like the email coming from outside your work’s network, that is has suspicious content, or even that malicious content was detected. </p>

                With our technical indicators, we can now really confirm if an email is a phishing attack or legitimate. <br><br>


                1. The sender address. <br>
                This sender address could be real, but the use of the dash in 'e-gress' could be an attempt to fake the domain. <br><br>

                2. The URL is obfuscated <br>
                While a safe looking link is presented in the email, when hovered it actually leads to a different URL entirely, a common tactic to hide malicious links. <br><br>

                3. The URL <br>
                The URL is different to the text in the email, instead taking us to 'accounts-egress.com'. This uses a dash to make the URL unique, but similar to the original website, but we now know it's a fake.. <br><br>
