                        <p class="card-text">When examining an email, consider that phishing attacks are designed to tug at your emotions.
                            They’re trying to make you not think, and to click on the link or attachment they provide.
                            This may be in the form of someone asking for help, a message prompt that needs to be clicked to view,
                            or monetary rewards such as job offers or tax refunds from the government. They will use the content of
                            the email to make you ignore the other indicators by using the trust you have for existing brands.<br><br>

                            Empathy is a common tool for fraudulent emails. The contents will attempt to convince you that they're someone out of luck,
                            swamped with work, and desperately need your help. You naturally feel for them, as humans want to be helpful, but it's
                            important to keep an eye out for when an email will attempt to tug on your heartstrings to take advantage of you. Always
                            check the indicators first before acting on emotions.

                            Using Fear, a phishing attack tries to pressure you that you’ll lose access to something unless you act now.
                            This is often done through fake bills, losing access to your accounts, threats of bank closure, or claims you’re in trouble and need to fix
                            your mistake quickly. They can also use the fear of authority figures, a message from your boss you’re less
                            likely to question, which is a perfect opportunity to trick you.

                        <p class="card-text">Your own curiosity can be used against you, as we’re often browsing our
                            emails looking for news or something interesting to read. All it takes is for you to not
                            quite pay attention, and see something intriguing you click on without thinking, and you’re
                            following a phishing email’s demands. Such examples as ‘you have messages, click here to
                            read them’ are common, alongside gossip-based emails spouting the latest trends of celebrities and shows.

                        <p class="card-text">Greed is used when a phishing attack gives incentives for engaging with the email.
                            Often offering monetary rewards in the form of free vouchers or paid surveys. Remember the old
                            saying that if something seems too good to be true, it probably isn’t. More examples include
                            Job offers or rare items being sold for cheap on auction sites. </p>

                Examining this email we recognise from the contextual indicators, that this email doesn't feel quite right. We've never worked for Standford before,
                 and although we are a student, it feels too good to be true... <br><br>


                1.Greed <br>
                The email is offering a rare monetary incentive for remote work. As a student, this would be fantastic money. But it's important to follow our instinct that it doesn't feel quite right. <br><br>

                2. Curiosity <br>
                Leveraging our curious nature, the email provides an opportunity to learn more about the process. We may want to find out who this is, how they found our email,
                and what kind of work it would be. But this would all result in us engaging with the phishing attacker, and giving them the information they seek, at our detriment <br><br>

                3. Empathy <br>
                While not as strong as the other elements, the email also calls for empathy as it asks for help from other students. As a fellow student, you're able to relate to the work that needs to be done. <br><br>
