                        <p class="card-text">Everytime you look at an email, consider the 5 basic questions first. <br><br>

                            Did I expect this email? <br><br>

                            Do I recognise the sender?  <br><br>

                            Is there a generic greeting or does the email know my name? <br><br>

                            Is it trying to grab my attention through deception? <br><br>

                            Is it trying to pressure me into a decision? <br><br>

                        <p class="card-text"> A phishing email will tend to pressure you into following up on their message, remember that it's their goal
                            to engage you in the content of the email, no matter what. These sorts of pressures and incentives could be creative, so it's best to be vigilant,
                            but the 4 most common to remember are:<br><br>

                            Are they invoking your empathy, to try to get you to 'help' them? <br><br>

                            Are they invoking fear, to try to scare you into clicking on the email? <br><br>

                            Are they trying to make you curious, by offering interesting information or gossip? <br><br>

                            Are they tempting your greed, with money offers or rare items? <br><br>


                            These social indicators often make up what's called a 'Call to Action', that exclaims something in the email and links their website, urging you to click as soon as possible.

                        <h5 class="card-title">3 Technical Indicators</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Technical indicators provide the best proof of phishing attacks, but can be the most difficult to decipher.
                            Especially as phishing attackers change their tactics and use clever methods to hide their fake domain and URLs. <br><br>

                            Just remember the key details that their URL and sender address generally cannot be the same as who they're pretending to be.<br><br>

                            A URL may be dangerous if it contains:<br><br>

                            Numbers and random characters inside the link. E.g. www.hdwefsefww.com<br>

                            Spelling mistakes in the URL, trying to hide their fake name. E.g. www.Ammazon.com<br>

                            Use of dots and dashes within the name to try to copy the website they're imitating. E.g. www.eBay-services.purchase.help.com<br>

                            A bundle of numbers in the form of an IP address, instead of words. E.g. www.182.42.123.22.1.com<br>

                        <h5 class="card-title">4 Wrap-up and next exercise</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Overall these indicators should give you a good idea of the most common signs of a bulk phishing attack.
                            You may receive them occasionally on your personal email, and while most likely go to a junk folder, it's important to stay aware.<br><br>

                            The next exercise is simulating looking at emails and deciding if they're real or fake. This is meant to simulate your normal email workflow,
                            where you check your emails and decide which ones to respond to. <br>
                            Unlike regular emails, this exercise gives you direct feedback that tells you if the email was a phishing attack,
                            or a legitimate source, and explains the indicators that prove it to be so.<br><br>

                            There are ten questions in the next portion, feel free to take your time examining each email before deciding your answer, and remember the indicators of attack. <br>
                            Most of the emails being used are live examples from real phishing attack emails, so should provide a decent challenge and authenticity to real attacks.<br>
