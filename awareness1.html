                        <p class="card-text">Every day you check your emails for messages from work, entertainment, friends,
                            shopping, and more. There are tools to keep your emails safe, but it’s ultimately up to you what emails you respond to. <br><br>

                            You’ve likely heard of ‘Phishing’ attacks before, this is where an email is sent to you pretending to be real but wants you to ‘click’ on a link,
                            website, or file attachment, that would harm your device. A Phishing attack can harm your device by installing malicious software or convinces you to go to a
                            ‘fake website’ that looks identical to a real one where you would input your login details, stealing those details and the account.

                        <p class="card-text">Most emails you read, respond, or follow their instructions to connect with friends, confirm shopping orders, or check your accounts. When you receive a Phishing email,
                            it’s important to be able to detect it and avoid interacting with the email. The best response if you think an email is suspicious is to examine it for ‘indicators of phishing’ to confirm
                            it’s not a real email and report it to your organization or email provider. <br> <br>



                            It’s worth knowing that most emails you receive will be legitimate, and it’s important not to assume they’ll all be attacks,
                            or you’ll never get on with your day and get ‘security fatigue’. Just keep your eyes open and know that some people will try to trick you with fake emails. <br><br>

                            Whenever you see the easy to spot indicators the next part will teach you, you can stop and examine the email fully to check and feel safe. </p>

                        <p class="card-text">This training looks to change your ‘Heuristics’, also known as your email habits. This just
                            means changing your subconscious decision-making when you look
                            at an email and simply “know” whether it’s real or fake. Once you decide an email feels wrong, then you look at
                            it ‘systematically’ where you investigate further for technical and social indicators of attack. <br><br>

                            There are 3 categories of indicators you should know.<br><br>

                            Contextual, Social, and Technical. <br><br>

                            Contextual indicators are what you most often use to get a 'feel' for the trust of a message, and ask the basic questions.
                            <br>
                            Social indicators analyse the content of the email to see if it's trying to grab your attention and pull you in emotionally.
                            <br>
                            Technical indicators are the best clues to detect a phishing attack, but can be the most difficult to read into, especially for a normal user.
                            <br><br>
                            Aside from technical, not every indicator proves it's a phishing email, but these are the most common similarities whenever an attack takes place.

                        <p class="card-text">The most obvious clues are to look at the title and contents of an email and ask yourself a
                            few questions for the context of the message. You likely do this already without thinking. <br><br>


                            Do I recognize the sender? Is this someone I’ve emailed before and know to trust?<br>

                            E.g., A friend who I’ve emailed many times before, you can generally trust.<br><br>



                            Did I expect this email?<br>

                            E.g., An unexpected order from a company you haven’t used before may be a fake email.<br><br>



                            Does this email know me? Is the email using a generic greeting or does it have your name and details already?<br>

                            E.g., A typical attack wouldn’t know who you are so can only include a generic greeting, but a real email from your Bank would know your full name and contact details.<br><br>



                            Is the email trying to grab my attention through deception? <br>


                            E.g., A Phishing email will try to grab your attention as much as possible, with deceptive editing to include logos of trusted brands, or fake security symbols.<br><br>


                            Is the email trying to pressure me into a decision? <br>

                            E.g., Phishing attacks want you to act quickly without analysing the contents of the email, and often use threats or emotional tools to make you click. <br><br>




                            These 5 simple questions should let you become suspicious when an email doesn’t feel quite right, and let you start to look closer
                            for the details that reveal the fake aspects of the message.
                            Try not to let the content of the message change how you trust the email, just because it’s a request from help or apparently comes from your bank,
                            all emails should pass these contextual questions first. A phishing email can easily fake any organization including their email format.
